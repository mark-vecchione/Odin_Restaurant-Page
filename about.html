        <div class="about-content">Cafe Vecchio is a living testament to tradition and culinary passion, having opened its doors in 1842 and been 
            lovingly run by 12 generations of our family. Our roots trace back to the vibrant culinary cultures of Naples and Bari, where time-honored 
            recipes were first crafted and passed down. Today, we blend these cherished traditions with modern techniques to serve authentic Italian dishes 
            that honor our heritage. Each plate is prepared with locally sourced ingredients, celebrating the rich flavors of classic Italian cookingâ€”from 
            our hand-crafted pastas to our wood-fired pizzas. At Cafe Vecchio, we believe in treating every guest like family, sharing our history, our values, 
            and our love for the art of food in every meal.</div>
